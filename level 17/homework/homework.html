    <h1>about elon musk</h1>
    <main>

        <P>Elon Reeve Musk (born June 28, 1971) is a prominent entrepreneur, inventor, and CEO known for his leadership in several high-profile technology companies. He is the founder and CEO of SpaceX, the CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc., and the owner of X Corp., the parent company of the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Musk is also involved in several other ventures, including Neuralink (a neurotechnology company), The Boring Company (a tunnel construction company), and xAI (an artificial intelligence company).

            As of November 2024, Musk is the wealthiest individual in the world, with a net worth estimated at $304 billion by Forbes. He is also a key figure in the development of advanced transportation technologies, having proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain system, and supported the creation of SolarCity, which was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy.
            
            Born in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk moved to Canada at the age of 18, later attending Queen's University before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He briefly attended Stanford University in California before dropping out to pursue entrepreneurial ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded Zip2, an online city guide, which was sold to Compaq for $307 million in 1999. Later that year, he founded X.com, which would become PayPal after merging with Confinity in 2000. PayPal was acquired by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion, and Musk used $100 million from the sale to found SpaceX in 2002.
            
            Musk's role in Tesla began in 2004 when he invested in the company, later assuming the role of chairman and, eventually, CEO. Under his leadership, Tesla became a leading electric vehicle manufacturer, revolutionizing the automotive industry. Musk has also been involved in several other groundbreaking projects, including the development of reusable rockets at SpaceX, the creation of brain-machine interfaces at Neuralink, and the vision for underground transportation tunnels at The Boring Company.
            
            In 2022, Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion, rebranding it as X and merging it with X Corp. His leadership of the platform has been highly controversial, with criticisms about layoffs, platform changes, and an increase in hate speech and misinformation. Muskâ€™s views on various political and social issues have also made him a polarizing figure, including his support for right-wing political causes and his vocal advocacy of former President Donald Trump.
            
            In 2024, Musk became more active in U.S. politics, supporting Trump's candidacy and becoming his second-largest individual donor. That same year, President-elect Trump announced Musk as co-chair of the proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a new government initiative aimed at reducing regulations and eliminating wasteful expenditures.</P>
